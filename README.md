ðŸ‘‹ &nbsp;Hey There! <br/> I'm Franzua Andrez
======

I'm a passionate  software developer from [Guatemala](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Guatemala/@15.64,-91z/)
currently focused on learning JavaScript stuff.

I consider myself   curious  and a continuous learner, I always try to improve things, so on my spare time I like try and learning new things mostly tech stuff.


When Iâ€™m not working, you can find me skating, yeah I love to skate, specifically with inline skates.


**You can find me on:**
